              "\"This is the third complaint I have filed against Wells Fargo. First they opened a credit card in my husband 's name and mine. We did not request this card. I also found out they attached the credit card to an account that was in my name since XXXX. This account was set up for my job. All direct deposits for pay went to this account. I also had set up this account for online bill pay. They changed the primary owner of this account to my husband so that the credit card that Wells Fargo opened ILLEGALLY, without our approval or knowledge and added it as overdraft for the the account. In XXXX XXXX, I made transfers for XXXX transactions from another checking account in my name to what I thought was my primary account to pay bills over a 35 day period. Not only did Wells Fargo transfer those monies back into the checking but they also made cash advances on the credit card and charged us for overdraft protection resulting in almost {$500.00} in cash advance fees, interest, and this overdraft protection fee. Neither my husband or I knew that my primary account had been manipulated and my identity and my husband 's were stolen by using our social security information. Now today XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I have found my other credit card information has also been changed for the online bill pay lists placing all of my credit cards, different from my husbands and not in his name, changed to his name along with changing the account numbers for these cards. XXXX card number was not correct at all. I now have to check all of our credit card statements to make sure that the bills have been paid!!! My advice to any Wells Fargo account holder is to check everything in your accounts because they did a lot of damage not only in CA but across the US and in many different areas of your banking accounts!\""

              "1597758  This is the third complaint I have filed against Wells Fargo. First they opened a credit card in my husband 's name and mine. We did not request this card. I also found out they attached the credit card to an account that was in my name since XXXX. This account was set up for my job. All direct deposits for pay went to this account. I also had set up this account for online bill pay. They changed the primary owner of this account to my husband so that the credit card that Wells Fargo opened ILLEGALLY, without our approval or knowledge and added it as overdraft for the the account. In XXXX XXXX, I made transfers for XXXX transactions from another checking account in my name to what I thought was my primary account to pay bills over a 35 day period. Not only did Wells Fargo transfer those monies back into the checking but they also made cash advances on the credit card and charged us for overdraft protection resulting in almost {$500.00} in cash advance fees, interest, and this overdraft protection fee. Neither my husband or I knew that my primary account had been manipulated and my identity and my husband 's were stolen by using our social security information. Now today XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I have found my other credit card information has also been changed for the online bill pay lists placing all of my credit cards, different from my husbands and not in his name, changed to his name along with changing the account numbers for these cards. XXXX card number was not correct at all. I now have to check all of our credit card statements to make sure that the bills have been paid!!! My advice to any Wells Fargo account holder is to check everything in your accounts because they did a lot of damage not only in CA but across the US and in many different areas of your banking accounts!   \n",

PNC  Bak has failed to provide me with and explanation why {$360.00} was taken out of my personal checking account ending in  XXXX  on  XXXX ,   XXXX    XXXX . They have failed to provide me with the complete investigation file which  PNC Bank  claims I have mishandled my personal checking account.     This request is specifically directed to a letter dated  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX   Ref. #  XXXX . In that lette r PNC Ban k used as a reason to deny my request for a credit card.   see reason #  XXXX  \" Unsatisfactory handling of your relationsh ip ( s ) wit h us '' I have requested a detailed explanation of both issues 7 times, in writing, verbally over the phone and walking into branches. There are serious security issues with the {$360.00} ATM withdrawal of my account and I have a legal right to know what exactly happened. Further, if  PNC ban k is claiming I have mishandled my personal checking account, that claim has the potential to negatively impact my reputation.   I want the information i have requested and hoping  PNC ba nk will comply with federal and state laws that clearly state they MUST provide the information requested. Otherwise I will be forced to file civil claims and through that venue I will ascertain it.   \n",

Now today XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I have found my other credit card information has also been changed for the online bill pay lists placing all of my credit cards, different from my husbands and not in his name, changed to his name along with changing the account numbers for these cards. XXXX card number was not correct at all. I now have to check all of our credit card statements to make sure that the bills have been paid!!! My advice to any Wells Fargo account holder is to check everything in your accounts because they did a lot of damage not only in CA but across the US and in many different areas of your banking accounts!</td>\n",

first contacted me, I was only told that if I did not pay the debt off, my name would be reported to all XXXX credit bureaus. I was not told I had the right to verify the debt and that by disputing it, I would not have to pay anything until the issue was resolved. I agreed to pay XX/XX/XXXX, but only found out by mail a week later that I could have disputed the debt until I received verification. I then wrote to the Collection agency as did an attorney on my behalf asking them to cease further collection until the dispute was resolved. They still automatically withdrew money from my checking account this month, putting me in a very awkward position financially.   \n",

Bank rep failed to explain to me I had to transfer a minimum balance into the account by a certain time or get hit with service fees. I never received a statement the first few months as the fees were apparently waived somehow as a \" courtesy '' on new accounts, and I was traveling and did not use the account. I thought either PNC had automatically transferred money from one of my other bank accounts into the PNC account, or else the account was not fully activated till I went online and took some action. I received a debit card but did not get around to activating or using it. \n",
              "In XX/XX/XXXX I received out of the blue a statement from PNC showing that my balance was XXXX AND I owed them a XXXX dollar fee. I basically got charged a fee on an account I never used ; never put money into or out of, never activated or used the debit card, never logged into PNC Online Banking. It 's an inactive account and they charged me a fee without fully explaining that I would get hit with fees if I did n't put in a certain balance by a certain time. I have called them and asked that the account be closed and the fee waived. I did not open this account with the idea of owing the bank money, I thought I was getting a XXXX dollar incentive ( which I never got because I needed to use the debit card within some \" promotional period '' to get that money, apparently ). I was misled by the sales rep and I just want this to go away and I do NOT want to pay a fee on an account I NEVER USED. \n",

I recently received a letter that stated on XX/XX/19 their cards were being switched over to Elan Financial Services. The letter stated I could \" opt out '' of the transition if I chose to do so, and needed to contact them by XX/XX/19. The letter went on to recommend I check if I had any rewards points on balance before closing the account and to cash those points out before XX/XX/19. Tonight, XX/XX/19, I contacted the customer service number on my recent bill and was told by Elan services my current credit card with XXXX has a XXXX  balance and a new card has been issued to me. I did not authorize Elan or XXXX to do this and in fact was calling because I want to opt out of the transition. I have a balance transfer check I want to send from my new credit union and place on their new credit card. Elan further stated on the phone that if I closed out my account tonight I would lose all rewards points and suggested I check my point balance before proceeding. I hung up, went to my rewards site, logged in as usual and a message appeared stating \" Cardholder does not participate. '' I then called the number on the back of my CC, found my point balance via the automated menu, and then proceeded until a XXXX person answered. After explaining this whole mess, the XXXX customer service person stated \" they had jumped the gun '' on the transition. This all violates what is stated in their letter about this transition and I consider it a breech of contract. What recourse do I have to a ) get back my reward points?, b ) stop a credit transfer to Elan, a company I do NOT want to do business with?, and c ) make a clean break with both XXXX and Elan without it impacting my credit? Any help you can offer will be greatly appreciated!!   \n",

checks from my mortgage company Arvest Bank. As you can see for the year XXXX and XXXX stick out like sour thumb. You have closed case XXXX with out any merit or have given me copies of the Insurance Premium as well as cashed checks this has ROBO SIGN all over it, Also you have falsified and alter XXXX contract. Please see attached as you have removed the SCOPE OF THE WORK as well as the amount ROBO SIGN again. I have copies of originals Contracts from XXXX XXXX with initials in every page as well as a notary stamp with different dates. Also please see attached a copy of a new Authorization form from my new Attorney XXXX XXXX. This is not a duplicate complaint   \n",

checking account to my HSBC checking account. On XX/XX/XXXX, unbeknownst to me, HSBC unilaterally closed all of my accounts. XXXX attempted a reversal of the {$2300.00} on XXXX, which HSBC rejected. The money was never sent to me by HSBC nor was it credited back to my XXXX account. It is now XXXX. They are telling me that they do not have my money - tough luck. XXXX tells me they have the evidence that the money was not sent back. HSBC is being very wishy-washy.   \n",

I went through the process of entering in my pin number and the amount along with which account to take the funds out of only to have the ATM machine not to dispense any money. I waited a good 3 minutes to see if the machine would dispense any money, before attempting to it again since I had some bills to pay that was due in a day I really did not think nothing of it, so I attempted to try again only this time the ATM machine said withdraw is not allowed. A male was waiting to use the ATM and stated oh that ATM machine is always breaking down and went inside the branch. I was waiting longer than normal for my ATM card to be returned.\n",

XXXX. XXXX in turn gives me free shipping when I make purchases through their network of retailers. My most recent purchase, which I made using XXXX mobile application on my XXXX was completely botched. I ordered XXXX items, but only XXXX was communicated to their affiliated retailer for fulfillment. I should have received free shipping, but did not. The CFPB needs to know that American Express is doing business with partners that create issues for consumers.   \n",

Every month since the commencement of this loan, I have paid the hazard insurance premium on the property on my own, rather than having it escrowed. My insurance payment is currently {$420.00} on an annual basis and paid by me directly as part of a package of properties I own to the insurance agency, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( email from XXXX XXXX of XXXX attached p 16 of 16 ). \n",

              "Since this loan 's inception, my monthly mortgage payment that includes the amounts of principal, interest and real estate taxes has ranged from about {$680.00} to {$690.00} per month, depending on fluctuations in the real estate tax assessment. In XX/XX/2017, after an escrow analysis, the successor company to XXXX XXXX XXXX, now Mr. Cooper ( also known as XXXX XXXX XXXX ) increased my monthly payment amount from {$680.00} in XX/XX/2017 to {$2500.00} for XX/XX/2017 ( see Mr. Cooper Posted Payments document ), and demanded me to esrcow my hazard insurance, despite the fact that I had already paid the annual premium for 2017, and had been paying directly the annual premiums for over 10 years. \n",

While my total bill to the insurance agent, XXXX XXXX might be {$9500.00} annually, such amount includes properties in addition to the one subject to the mortgage with Mr. Cooper. Lastly, during a phone call with an agent of Mr. Cooper, I was requested to pay {$6800.00} towards the insurance escrow, and sent in a check for that amount, but I can not see from the records or information that Mr. Cooper provides where that {$6800.00} was applied.

account which is linked to my E-Checking count to avoid maintenance fees is no longer applicable. The email stated the \" waiver '' I have been receiving is being removed.This concerns me since I am a XXXX with medical issues and limited resources My daughter had the same issue, filed a complaint and received a call back promptly and an email. I have now called and left voice mails numerous times since last week with no answer nor call back, The # of the XXXX employee XXXX assigned to my complaint is XXXX ext. XXXX and her voice mail is not clear so last name is not discernible. She called me one time and never sent me an email to communicate. Again I have been calling an entire week leaving messages. Please have someone call and email me back immediately to get this situation handled before my cycle date. I would like a 1 year waiver such as which was granted to my daughter.Everything was clearly stated on my complaint and so I am not sure if the XXXX employee no longer works there or just does not return calls. Please have someone else reliable contact me from the XXXX customer service as the # I was given by XXXX is not the same department that handled my daughters complaint nor in the same time zone.Thanking you for out attention to this matter.   \n",

Corporation. My bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, reflects this {$73.00} charge from XXXX XXXX, 2016. This payment has never been reflected in my VSAC account. Shortly thereafter, my loan servicer became XXXX. Neither loan servicer shows a record of this payment. XXXX gave me a trace number : XXXX which should be useful in assisting VSAC in finding a record of this charge. \n",

I signed up using a promotional offer that made me eligible for {$450.00} bonus after successful direct deposits ( I have a screenshot of the offer ) I then finished my direct deposit requirement and called the bank around the end of XXXX. The agent verified that I have successfully completed the requirements for the bonus and I will receive it automatically in 90 days. \n",
              "I called the bank again around XXXX and they said bonus will post around XXXX end. \n",
              "\n",
              "When I finally called in XXXX they refused the bonus citing some bogus technical reasons. I have a screenshot of the offer with the link I used to open my account. \n",
              "Despite making repeated calls and even in-person visit to the branch they are just delaying the issue and have failed to provide any reasonable explanation for last 20 days. \n",
              "\n",
              "Here is my complaint number registered with citizens bank : XXXX Any help regarding this will be appreciated. \n",

of the loan and said that I needed to pay {$500.00} and that it would be applied to closing costs to start the process. First, they never did get the terms correct as promised in the disclosures. I called and called with very slow responses. Said they would fix the problem but they never did. The \" application fee '' showed up and they said it would be removed at closing. I said no, I want it removed now. They never did that. They were extremely incompetent or trying to deceive me. \n",

                              To whom it may concern, I would like to file a complaint regarding an unfortunate issue I had with opening a priority checking account with Citi Bank. In XXXX, I received some promotional offers from Citi for opening a priority checking account. The terms on the offer states that if I maintain a balance of XXXX for 60 consecutive calendar days, I would receive a bonus of {$700.00}. I opened the account on XX/XX/XXXX and made the deposit of $ XXXX into the account on XX/XX/XXXX. \n",
              "\n",
              "As of XX/XX/XXXX, about 91 calendar days after the deposit, I haven't received the opening bonus so I called Citi Bank trying to resolve the issue. I was told by Citi Bank that I had to wait an additional 90 days after the 60 consecutive calendar days to get the opening bonus, which was not presented in the online offer. This took my by surprise that a requirement like this should be presented clearly to the new customers. This is not a good practice to attract new customers to open accounts with Citi Bank. \n",

                               I have had a mortgage for many years, and the escrow has always been adjusted once a year with either an increase in the escrow or an escrow refund ( depending on taxes ). That escrow rebalance has always been done in XXXX with the new payment in effect as of XX/XX/XXXX. My last re-adjustment was in XX/XX/2018, with an increase in payment for the tax escrow on XX/XX/2018. \n",

              "Even though these adjustment are supposed to be once a year, the bank just increased my escrow amount effective XX/XX/XXXX - the second increase in just a couple of months. So I guess this means banks can now increase escrow payments any time they want to?   \n",

somewhat glitchy \" submit '' button was presented on screen, noting that I 've made too many transactions within the hour, despite only making one other withdrawal. My account is verified as well, so this was odd. Eventually after trying 3 or 4 times, the transfer said \" submitted ''. This was XX/XX/XXXX. Around 13 days later ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I have still yet to receive the XXXX LTC from my XXXX account to my Binance account. On the Coinbase site, if you send any crypto from XXXX to another place, say a wallet or another exchange, there are two transaction notifications. One says \" Transferred X '' and the other says \" Sent X '', where X is the cryptocurrency. On this transaction, unlike the others, it just has \" Transferred X ''. The certificate on the site was valid, and I always read aloud and double check the addresses to make sure they are correct. All this causes me to believe that Coinbase still contains my LTC ( worth ~ {$50.00} ). I 've sent support tickets and called, but no response has been made and I would like my money back. I am Case # XXXX.   \n",

It had a balance on it that Citi Prepaid ( 3rd party contracted by Citibank ) refuses to reissue. Per CFPB, the balance is valid for 5 years even if the card expires. I spoke to XXXX, rep number XXXX who despite being informed of the CFPB guidance refused to comply and refused to reissue the card or the amount. I feel cheated out of my money.   \n",

                                   I paid this loan off in full on XX/XX/XXXX. I received a receipt but not a pay off letter. I then received a letter in the mail in XXXX of XXXX saying that this debt had been sent over to a another collection agency. I contacted money key and they said they couldn't help me because I had to speak with the collection agency. The collection agency was less than helpful. So I contacted the creditor that the money was paid to. They sent me a paid in full letter. However they keep sending the debt to different collection agency to try and collect more. I need this to stop as it is affecting my credit and reputation. Thank you.   \n",

At the beginning of the month my roommate, who also happens to be a relative, wrote me a check for her part of the rent. I did a mobile deposit that night because I live XXXX miles from a banch. 3 days later Bank of America reverses the check for no apparent reason. I called customer service and the agent assured me it was okay to try the deposit again. I verified with my roommates bank that she had the funds available. So the next day, I had my roommate write me another check for the same amount and I do another mobile deposit. The following Monday Bank of America placed a hold on the funds. I called them and they told me to call their risk department. \n",

              "During my call with the risk department I was told they were closing my account. I asked about the check, and they said they would reverse it after a week. A week passes and I called again to find out why my roommate had n't seen the funds go back into her account. At that point they said the check was still on hold, and after it had cleared they would send me a cashiers check. \n",

transaction which closed on XX/XX/2019 through XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX located in XXXX, PA. Shortly after closing my loan was transferred to The XXXX XXXX, who apparently sold the servicing rights to Flagstar Bank. My Account number with Flagstar is XXXX. My first payment due date was XX/XX/2019. I received a payment notice from both The Money Source and Flagstar both requesting I make my first payment to each of them. I contacted my original lender and he has been trying to get to the bottom of this ever since. The payment notice I received from Flagstar was incorrect as they failed to include the escrow amount of my School Taxes. My correct total monthly payment should have been {$3100.00}. After several months of back and forth with Flagstar, they still can't get my payment amount correct. Just recently they sent me an escrow refund check of over {$5800.00}, but that should not be returned to me since I need this in my escrow account to pay future taxes. Flagstar is also \" double charging '' me the cost of my monthly mortgage insurance. The correct amount of my monthly PMI is {$200.00}, but the dopes at Flagstar are trying to charge me {$410.00}. They are so bad and now I am afraid my payments will be reported late. My original lender, XXXX XXXX has been trying in vain to straighten this out, but to no avail. Please help me. I have been unjustly persecuted by Flagstar!  All I want to do is make my monthly payments for the correct amount. Please Help Me!   \n",

a collection account had been added to my credit bureaus. I never received any type of notification from AFNI which would allowed me to dispute the account.

She also said she was sending authorities to my house or any other address they have on file for me. She has also left messages on my son 's answering machine, my sister 's, my brother in law 's answering machine and talked to my other brother in law who lives in another state and told them the exact same thing. That I am being charged with Finiancial Fraud and she is a a Fraud Investigator with the State of Va, and that I may have a warrent for my arrest. My family has called me in a panic. I called the number back that she left with a \" docket number '' she referenced and I reached a man named XXXX XXXX. When I asked him the name of the company that he works for, he said XXXX Legal, he said they are a law firm. When I looked them up, it was a collection agency called XXXX. I requested that no one else from this company contact me or my family. I also asked for the company address and fax number so that I can put that request in writting. He said they do not have a fax #. I have looked this company up and they have some very scary and threatening tactics they use, such as harrassing your neighbors and family, continual calls at home and work, and even coming to your home. I am a single parent with small children, and I am just afraid someone is going to come to my home in order to intimidate me, because the lady said on my answering machine that they will go to my address. This debt they are trying to collect is in dispute with the cmpany and has been for a while. I know that there are legal ways to conduct business, and this is not one of them, this is threatening and harrassing.   \n",

    I ended service with XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and switched to another service provider with no balance owed to XXXX. After switching, XXXX continued to bill my account with no data plan in place, no phone service and no notice of the continued billing. The balance appeared on my credit report over a year later in XXXX as a collection and I have disputed the account several times with the company and received successful deletion, but the account has in turn, been sold to at least 2 different collection agencies and constantly appears on my credit report and affects my score negatively. It is now being reported by XXXX XXXX XXXX with a balance of {$3500.00} reporting as recentas XX/XX/XXXX as if it is a new debt and has been negativelyaffecting mycredit score. Please investigate this account and provide accurate information that will stop this fromhappening anylonger. I have requested information from XXXX and they have not furnished any proof of the debt owed because I do not owe the debt and the information being reported is inaccurateand illegal.   \n",

 XXXX XXXX. The amount was {$44000.00} to guarantee to Comerica Bank. XXXX told me it would only be for a few months. I left the company in XXXX as XXXX brought in new management. I received letters from Comerica that they were going to send my money to unclaimed funds for non-activity. I withdrew {$40000.00}. In XX/XX/XXXX Comerica threatened to sue me if I didn't return the money. I did. In XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Comerica stating that XXXX had defaulted on its loan and they were confiscating my {$44000.00}. According to the documents I signed, I was to be notified of any changes or modifications to this loan, as a guarantor. I was never notified of any changes or modifications to the loan that they made with XXXX. As a result I contacted a lawyer and should receive my money, however Comerica is not releasing it and has put a hold on it. I have been corresponding with : XXXX XXXX XXXX, Vice President Comerica Bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX Email : XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX Direct ( XXXX ) XXXX Fax They will not release my funds after breaking their fiduciary duty with me and breaking the bank covenants with me. Please help me with this. My phone # is XXXX and email is XXXX. Thank you so much, XXXX XXXX XXXX   \n",

Because we were struggling to make ends meet. And wanting to keep our home and not wanting to be foreclosed on so are mortgage company made us think that a loan modification is our only option and forced us into a ridiculously high numerous fees charges loan modification or we lose our home to foreclosure.. and this loan modification has put us in so much financial stress and it all started from our mortgage company and Ive already filed a complaint about this with our {$580.00} insurance premium that went missing back in 2015 that was supposed to be paid to XXXX XXXX.. We are getting nowhere with our loan through our mortgage company because our mortgage company doesnt want to work with their customers with American people that have families and that have lives and a mortgage company like I have my loan through does this to me and my family. And will not address any of my concerns regarding my loan or my loan modification agreement my escrow account my homeowners insurance anything that has to do with my loan from top to bottom my mortgage company will not address my concern at all. And so I now doing my own research know that this is not my only option to keep my home for myself and my husband and my kids and Im not going to stop until I get the justice we deserve weve been with this mortgage company for 10 years weve suffered for 10 years from day one with this mortgage company they are nothing but dirty crooks that dont care about American people.. this mortgage company uses fraud and kickbacks to get what they want from their customers loans.

We received the check for XXXX from our insurance company and send the package to Nationstar Mortgage with ALL required paperwork. They received it on XXXX/XXXX/2015. Till this day Nationstar did not do disbursement to us. I called numerous times without any results. Here is the dates : XXXX/XXXX/2015, XX/XX/2015,XX/XX/2015,XX/XX/2015,XX/XX/2015,XX/XX/2015,XX/XX/2015,XX/XX/2015,XX/XX/2015.Every time I call, I stay on the phone 20-40 minutes. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I was waiting for supervisor, her name is XXXX for almost 2 hours, only for her to tell me that she will follow up on my disbursement request, which she never did. Nationstar is using off shore operators, who are poorly trained, they can not explain anything, they read notes on the screen and do n't understand a thing about the process. I feel that Nationstar is abusing its customers. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I spoke to XXXX, who told me that somebody misplaced the contractor 's bead and my disbursement was stopped. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 spoke to XXXX for the 4th time, stayed on the phone with her 33 minutes, once again was told that disbursement request is send for approval, and she will call me back tomorrow to follow up. Of course, no one called and there was no check send to us. In the meantime insurance company issued us an other check. Nationstar is holding {$100000.00} of our money. The water damage was very extensive, my family has to stay in the half destroyed house. We are desperate, we want to start repairs. It is absolute nightmare to deal with Nationstar loss department. Nationstar mortgage needs to train their loss department operators, so they will do their job. Please, help us.   \n",

deposit $ XXXX and left it in the account for 30 days. I deposited the $ XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX. So on XXXX XXXX XXXX I fulfilled the requirements for the bonus. The terms say that the bonus should post 90 days after the requirements have been completed. So I should have received the bonus 90 days after XXXX XXXX XXXX, which is XXXX XXXX XXXX. It is over a weeks since that date and the bonus has not yet posted. I have been back and forth emailing and calling them to no avail. I have an email confirming that I fulfilled the bonus and that the bonus should post by XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, even showing them this email they have to said they need to launch an 'investigation ' which will take up to 30 days. I do n't see why they need to investigate anything when I already have an email from them saying that I have fulfilled the bonus and should receive payment.   \n",

                                                       I was granted guardianship of an incompetent individual on XX/XX/XXXX. In late XXXX, I was granted payee for the same person. I am trying to open a joint checking account, as instructed by SS, and PNC keeps giving me the runaround as to why I ca n't!! I have been to probate three times, SS once and I have all the documentation that is legally required to open and account and pay this man 's monthly bills.   \n",

credit report, saying the account was opened on XX/XX/2019. I have not been in the hospital in years and even if so, I have insurance that covers 100 %. This debt is not mine and this company needs to remove this IMMEDIATELY. This happens all too often with this company. They also sent NO correspondance regarding this fraudulent debt, another violation of the FDCRA. I knew nothing of the mistake to even dispute it before they just popped it on my credit report.   \n",

investors for funds, the investors supplied money for the business to get under way. The bank of America froze my account and I called the bank when I found out no funds were available and I knew funds were in the account the bank is saying that this was not my money in the account and this is why we froze your account. I have the sum of {$1700.00} due me from the bank of America and went to the bank today to resolve this matter they refused still to pay me my money. I received today a letter from the state of California State Controllers office stating the funds If I do not get from the bank of America by XX/XX/2018 the business is required by law to send the funds to the state controllers office ( SCO ) and can be claimed by me there. I tried to resolve this today XX/XX/2018 but the bank of America still refuses to send the funds or pay me the money due me   \n",

On XX/XX/XXXX, their delivery service called me and scheduled delivery for Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, to the room of my choice, which is the service I paid for when purchasing the furniture and what enabled me to purchase the furniture. Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, a customer service representative from XXXX called and told me that they would only be able to deliver the four chests of drawers to my doorstep due to COVID-19 restrictions. I live alone in upstate New York and have no way to get the furniture that weighs hundreds of pounds each inside, much less upstairs to my bedroom. If delivery to the room of my choice had not been an option when purchasing from XXXX, I would not have purchased the furniture at all. XXXX 's customer service representative told me to hire a local moving company to bring the furniture inside and to the room of my choice. Under the current extraordinary pandemic conditions, no one would be able to cross a threshold to do that. I initiated return of the furniture to XXXX. They classified the return as a \" buyer 's remorse '' return and deducted {$230.00} for return shipping from the refund to my XXXX credit card. They were not able to perform the service I paid for when purchasing the furniture that enabled the purchase of heavy furniture in the first place. Because they would have been able to deliver the furniture to my doorstep, XXXX considers that fulfillment of the purchase contract and chose to classify the return as \" buyer 's remorse, '' which it is not.   \n",
              "527927   On XX/XX/2020, I filed for bankruptcy and an Official Form 108-Statement of Intent for Individual Filing under Chapter XX/XX/XXXX was faxed and mailed to Rushmore Loan Management Services LLC requesting that I wanted to \" Retain the property and in enter into a Reaffirmation Agreement. '' On XX/XX/2020, I talked to the Bankruptcy Department after being transfer from the Customer Service Department at Rushmore and was told I needed a letter on letterhead paper from my attorney with my property information and that I would like to enter into a \" Reaffirmation Agreement ''. I talked to my attorney and he said that is not how it should work and re-faxed the Official Form 108 to Rushmore at the same number XXXX again. \n",
              "On XX/XX/2020, my Bankruptcy wasXX/XX/XXXX On XX/XX/2020, I noticed a paragraph on my monthly statements from Rushmore : \" Our records shout that this loan may be subject to either a bankruptcy stay or a XX/XX/XXXX of personal liability through bankruptcy, We are sending you this statement for informational and compliance purposes only. It is not an attempt to collect a debt against you. If you want to stop receiving statements, write to us at the Correspondence address list on the next page. '' Although when I called the automated service it told me my payment for {$690.00} and the due date is always the XXXX of the month.I am still making my payments. I talked to the Customer Service Department who put me on hold to talk to the Bankruptcy department who stated that they did not have a copy of the Official Form 108 and I would need to send a letter stating my intent to enter into a Reaffirmation agreement. My attorney told me once again that Rushmore did not know what they were doing and there was no communication between the departments On XX/XX/2020, my attorney told me Rushmore should have sent a form to him concerning the reaffirmation to my loan which they didn't. Right now I am protected by the Bankruptcy but I should continue to make my payments. He also said to start a spreadsheet with the amount I paid the date paid along with a breakdown of the payment. This is in case for some reason Rushmore tried to foreclose on the loan at some point. The company is not sophisticated enough to know how to handle a bankruptcy so I need to make sure I have all my information on a spreadsheet, On XX/XX/2020, I was able to talk to the Bankruptcy Department again and was once again told to send a letter, I was told to call back the next day before XXXX XXXX  and talk to XXXX who handled my Bankruptcy for any details as they only have a few notes in their system. My attorney told me to stop \" beating my head against a brick wall '' and continue with the spreadsheet. \n",
              "On XX/XX/2020, I filled out a survey from Rushmore about their Customer Service Representatives. I included all the information about what I was told by the Customer Service Department and the Bankruptcy Departments. Also included that I can get the correct information when using the automated service that would give me the dollar amount and when my payment was due. \n",
              "On XXXX XXXX, I received a phone call from Rushmore Escalated Customer Service Department concerning the survey I filled out with all the negative comments. She listen to my concerns about the Reaffirmation Agreement and that my payments for my loan were not being reported to the three Credit Bureaus. She placed me on hold to talk to the Bankruptcy Department about my concerns. She tried talking to the Bankruptcy Department but was unable to understand the person as they spoke very quietly, I had talked to the same person in the past and was unable to her understand her also. Bottom line, I either wanted a Reaffirmation agreement or my payments reported to the Credit Bureaus and she was going to do some more investigation. \n",
              "On XX/XX/2020, I received a followup call from the Rushmore Escalated Customer Service Department. I was given the same information that I needed to my attorney to send in writing that I wanted to a Reaffirmation agreement. I politely told the Representative that was not going to happen because my attorney had already sent copies of the Statement of Intention To File Under Chapter XXXX. The Customer Service Department can not see what the Bankruptcy Department can see because they are a different entity. I told her, my attorney advised me to keep a spreadsheet of a breakdown of my payments along with the confirmation number and a breakdown of my payments. This was to prevent foreclosure. She said to keep doing that since it was the advice of my attorney, She did agree the Bankruptcy Department was wrong. Also because the way the Bankruptcy Department has my loan coded, it will never be reported to the three Credit Bureaus. I explained this was not helping my FICO score but again the Bankruptcy Department Department is a different entity. I told her I filed a complaint with the XX/XX/XXXXbecause Rushmore had so many complaints about their Customer Service and Rushmore. She said she was sorry and that was all the help she could give me. \n",
              "On XX/XX/2020, I called the Escalated Customer Service Department to ask about a check I received on XX/XX/2020, I received a check from Rushmore 'FOR PAYMENT OF ESCROW TO MORTGAGOR ''. I thought the Bankruptcy Department was sending me a check because they were no longer going to pay my Real Estate taxes anymore. I was told Rushmore really did have me pay more. With my XXXX payment, I would only pay {$650.00}. \n",
              "On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an ANNUAL ESCROW ACCOUNT DISCLOSURE STATEMENT AND CHANGE OF PAYMENT NOTICE PREPARED FOR my loan number with an analysis date of XX/XX/2020 ; Because of the way loan is coded ( inactive loan ) by the Bankruptcy Department, I can not access my loan online to make payments or find out any information on my loan. I have to call the automated service to pay my loan and exit out of the automated system to get a customer service representative. \n",
              "I do not care about the Reaffirmation agreement because according to an article my attorney sent me it is best not to sign a Reaffirmation agreement as long as I keep making my payments. I would like to have my payments sent to the three Credit Bureaus to help with my FICO score.

Right now I am protected by the Bankruptcy but I should continue to make my payments. He also said to start a spreadsheet with the amount I paid the date paid along with a breakdown of the payment.

She said to keep doing that since it was the advice of my attorney, She did agree the Bankruptcy Department was wrong. Also because the way the Bankruptcy Department has my loan coded, it will never be reported to the three Credit Bureaus.

Because of the Bankruptcy, I was told my the Mortgage Loan department of my Bank, it would be 18 to 24 months before I could get a new loan but the increase in my FICO score would go a long way in shortening that time period.</td>\n",
